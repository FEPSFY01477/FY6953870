A major geotechnical hazard that has had profound impacts on the stability of civil engineering infrastructures is Earthquake-Induced Soil liquefaction. During this
 dissertation,  I aim to explore the consequences of Earthquake-Induced Soil liquefaction reinforced through analysis of real-life case studies. 
The Article first examines the mechanisms of the soil liquefaction. Since Liquefication leads to significant structural and safety issues.
 Therefore, the following section will discuss the structural implications. This will follow with a case study that I have done on some extensive
 earthquakes, including Christchurch (2011), Niigata (1964) and Kobe (1995), these examples demonstrate the challenges that liquefaction introduces
 to civil engineering practice.

Artificial intelligence(AI) has significantly influenced and impacted different fields of engineering. During this dissertation, I aim to explore how vastly AI has strengthened and benefited particularly in civil engineering.
The first section will present the background and the history of this ground breaking technology and its profound impact on human society. Whilst any new technology has significant advantages it also comes with its own drawbacks, and AI is no different. Therefore, we will discuss AI’s benefits and at the same time we will look at the negative impact of it.
This will follow with a case study that I have done on a few civil engineering companies who are actively applying AI in their day to day operation and seeing the immense benefit of it in their productivity and at the same the drawback of this technology that these firms are encountering.

 During an earthquake, soils can undergo a sudden change in stress conditions that cause them to transition from a solid state to behaving more like a liquid.
 Soil is made up of solid grains with water filled pores between them, and its strength mainly depends on effective stress, which is the force transmitted
 between those grains. When an earthquake occurs, the propagation of stress waves increases the pore water pressure within the soil. As pore water pressure rises,
 effective stress drops, meaning the grains lose contact with one another and the soil rapidly loses strength and structure. At this point, the soil can temporarily 
 behave like a fluid, becoming soft and unable to support loads, which may cause buildings to settle unevenly, tilt or even collapse. The soil’s particle size
 distribution, shape and gradation also influence how easily it can density and lose strength under these conditions.
 
 After liquefaction, the weakened ground may sink downward as the particles settle into a denser, more compact arrangement, a process which is known as ground surface
 subsidence.  Subsidence, whether triggered by earthquakes, landslides or human activity, can significantly affect the long-term stability and safety of buildings 
 and infrastructure.
