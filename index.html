A major geotechnical hazard that has had profound impacts on the stability of civil engineering infrastructures is Earthquake-Induced Soil liquefaction. During this dissertation, I aim to explore the consequences of Earthquake-Induced Soil liquefaction reinforced through analysis of real-life case studies. 
The Article first examines the mechanisms of the soil liquefaction. Liquefication leads to significant structural and safety issues. Therefore, the following section will discuss the structural implications. This will follow with a case study that I have done on some extensive earthquakes, including Christchurch (2011), Niigata (1964) and Kobe (1995), these examples demonstrate the challenges that liquefaction introduces to civil engineering practice.

      <pre id="Introduction_in_text">
One of the main geotechnical risks in civil engineering is associated with seismic activity which is Earthquake- Induced Soil liquefication .When there are seismic vibrations during an earthquake the loose soil particles and saturated pores experience extreme shaking thus increasing the pore water pressure, which reduces effective stress and causes the soil to lose its strength and rigidity. Soil can behave like fluid temporarily during this, which leads to ground deformation, lateral spreading, uneven settlement, and the failure of foundations. These effects can endanger long-term ground subsidence as soil particles reorganise into a denser state after liquefaction but also threaten the stability of buildings and infrastructure during the earthquake.. The most vulnerable areas are ones which are supported by loose sand and pores filled with high water contents . This will be discussed more in detail through 3 major case studies explored in the article - Kobe (1995) and Christchurch (2011).

      During an earthquake, soils can undergo a sudden change in stress conditions that cause them to transition from a solid state to behaving more like a liquid.  Soil is made up of solid grains with water filled pores between them, and its strength mainly depends on effective stress, which is the force transmitted between those grains. When an earthquake occurs, the propagation of stress waves increases the pore water pressure within the soil. As pore water pressure rises, effective stress drops, meaning the grains lose contact with one another and the soil rapidly loses strength and structure. At this point, the soil can temporarily behave like a fluid, becoming soft and unable to support loads, which may cause buildings to settle unevenly, tilt or even collapse. The soil’s particle size distribution, shape and gradation also influence how easily it can density and lose strength under these conditions. After liquefaction, the weakened ground may sink downward as the particles settle into a denser, more compact arrangement, a process which is known as ground surface subsidence.  Subsidence, whether triggered by earthquakes, landslides or human activity, can significantly affect the long-term stability and safety of buildings and infrastructure.

Port Island and Rokko Island are man-made islands built on the seabed near the shore, and this was produced by depositing granite and crushed mudstone into the sea 2 m below the water surface. Both materials in the fill were coarse, well-graded granular fills with only minor variation in fines, and the fill that resulted from this was uncompacted and fully saturated, making the islands vulnerable to earthquake-induced liquefaction. While these deeper layers were dumped from barges, the upper few metres were placed above water, making them compacted, stronger, and more stable; however, when seismic shaking sharply increased pore water pressure, the islands lost strength and liquefied. Settlement occurs when soil compresses under load, and as the pore water carries part of the load, the pore pressure rises until the water drains and soil particles move closer together. During settlement and strength loss, the soil progressed sideways toward free faces near quay walls and shorelines, eroding foundations and causing tilting, cracking, and uneven sinking—behaviour known as lateral spreading. When liquefaction ended, soil particles rearranged into a denser configuration, causing significant vertical settlement. 
Most quay walls moved about 5 m toward the sea and inclined 3–4 degrees, while shoreline quay walls moved 2–3 m outward and settled roughly 1 m, and liquefaction caused 20–50 cm of ground settlement. Pipeline damage was extensive, with 1,757 cumulative distribution pipe failures, since soft, liquefied soil could not support buried lines. Cast-iron pipe damage in liquefied zones was twice that in non-liquefied areas, and ductile T-cast iron with mechanical joints experienced four times greater damage in severely liquefied ground. The stresses during the earthquake exceeded the yield stress of pile materials, causing piles to bend sideways or shear. Even when some piles remained intact, settlement beneath them caused buildings to tilt and sink. Movement of the ground and quay walls displaced crane bases, pulling them off their rails and causing collapse, and crane rails were deformed, with severe crane damage particularly evident on Rokko Island; cracking and spalling also appeared at the tops of reinforced-concrete piles. 
The disaster underscored the importance of modern seismic standards, mandatory retrofitting, stricter codes, and advanced seismic isolation, along with ground-densification methods such as sand compaction piles, vibro-rods, vibro-flotation, dynamic consolidation, and vibratory tamping.

On 22nd February 2011, a 10 second Mw 6.2 earthquake occurred in Christchurch. This caused a total of 185 casualties and severe damage, mostly in the central business district (CBD) and the eastern suburban areas. The 10 seconds earthquake had disastrous effects which were due to the shallow focus and proximity to the city that had previously suffered damage from the 2010 canterbury earthquake. Out of nearly 3,000 buildings in the CBD, 70% had either been destroyed or deemed unfit for repair. However, the areas that received the most crucial damage were areas like Dallington, Merivale, Burnwood, and Addington which were in the eastern suburbs. This is because they were effected with liquefication that affected around 60,000 buildings. This included 20,000 severely damaged and 8,000 abandoned due to high costs of repairs. An approximate of 400,000 tones of silt were produced from the liquefication, which led to lateral spreading, tilted structures, and differential settlement, particularly in one story timber frame homes. 
Foundation types used in construction were influenced by the CBD soils that varied in composition. Nonuniform settlements and tilting's were formed due to the many buildings that were supported on shallow foundations that were resting on loose to medium dense sands and silty sands, which were liquefied during the earthquake. Major structural damage was caused to buildings. On the other hand, deep foundations succeeded in creating more stable soil layers and performed better during the earthquake. A key factor for the failure of the shallow foundations was liquefication, this was quite frequent in the medium and low-rise buildings in the CBD, which received significant damage from ground movements.  
Essential infrastructures such as water, sewer, power, and telecommunication systems were also damaged due to the widespread liquefication, which was around 80% of water mains damaged in the liquefied areas. Due to this, they created a zoning system to identify which areas were safe and areas that were not such as red zones. Red zones are areas with extensive geochemical damage, and were established due to liquefication risks, which meant that it was not possible to rebuild in this area because it would be uneconomical. To reduce the risk of liquefication-induced damage in vulnerable areas, and ensure the use of suitable foundation types, an important investigation of site-specific liquefication was conducted due to the seriousness of the earthquake.

In conclusion hydrogen vehicles seem promising, especially for long distance travel for things such as trucks and trains as they have a short refuel time comparable to current 
petrol and diesel vehicles. However, they still have a long way to go as there is still not a lot of infrastructure and for how costly they are to create and run.
