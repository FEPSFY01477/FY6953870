A major geotechnical hazard that has had profound impacts on the stability of civil engineering infrastructures is Earthquake-Induced Soil liquefaction. During this
 dissertation,  I aim to explore the consequences of Earthquake-Induced Soil liquefaction reinforced through analysis of real-life case studies. 
The Article first examines the mechanisms of the soil liquefaction. Since Liquefication leads to significant structural and safety issues.
 Therefore, the following section will discuss the structural implications. This will follow with a case study that I have done on some extensive
 earthquakes, including Christchurch (2011), Niigata (1964) and Kobe (1995), these examples demonstrate the challenges that liquefaction introduces
 to civil engineering practice.

Artificial intelligence(AI) has significantly influenced and impacted different fields of engineering. During this dissertation, I aim to explore how vastly AI has strengthened and benefited particularly in civil engineering.
The first section will present the background and the history of this ground breaking technology and its profound impact on human society. Whilst any new technology has significant advantages it also comes with its own drawbacks, and AI is no different. Therefore, we will discuss AI’s benefits and at the same time we will look at the negative impact of it.
This will follow with a case study that I have done on a few civil engineering companies who are actively applying AI in their day to day operation and seeing the immense benefit of it in their productivity and at the same the drawback of this technology that these firms are encountering.
